# Clustering the Semeion Handwritten Digits using the expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm

![alt text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EM_Clustering_of_Old_Faithful_data.gif)

In this project we will cluster handwritten digits data using the EM algorithm with a principle components step within each maximization. The contents in the folder are:

- Problem Statement.pdf: Description of the problem and EM Algorithm for a Principle Components Gaussian Mixture Model.
- Solution.Rmd: Solution of the problem.
- semeion.csv: Semeion Handwritten Digit Dataset (1593 handwritten digits written by a total of 80 individuals).
- MainCode.R: Complete code in R.
